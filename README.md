# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Aaditya Kansal

I'm a back-end developer with a focus on security and malware research. I spend a good amount of time reverse engineering, studying offensive techniques, and generally trying to understand how digital threats work.

This is my portfolio website, built using Next.JS and Tailwind CSS.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Firstly clone the repository.
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/Nightfire390/nightfire390.github.io.git && cd nightfire390.github.io
```
Install the required packages using npm.
```bash
npm install
```
Run the website.
```bash
npm run dev
```
The website should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000/
